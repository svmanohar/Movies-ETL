# Movies-ETL

### Project overview:

This project showcases a sample ETL process that is completed manually and step-wise initially, and then loaded into a series of functions and nested functions for scaleability. Dirty data is pulled from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and Movielens and is cleaned and merged. Decisions on including, excluding, and replacing data are made and documented accordingly. Finally, the cleaned dataframes are loaded into a PostgreSQL table for future use.
